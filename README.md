# Markov Aurelius: A Generator of Stoic Quotes

Uses Marcus Aurelius's "Meditations" and a Markov Chain to generate quotes to be shared on Twitter.

"Meditations" found at [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2680). 

Markov Chain adapted from [Jon Egil Strand's solution](http://rubyquiz.com/quiz74.html) to the Ruby Quiz question regarding said chains.

`Twitter posting to be figured out in the future.` Probably via the handle @therealmarkovaurelius
